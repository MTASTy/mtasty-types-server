  /**
   * Creates an area of water.
   * The largest possible size of a water area is 5996Ã—5996.
   * Also be aware that the function will change all x and y coordinates you specify into even integer numbers if necessary: this is because of a limitation of San Andreas.
   * You are able to give the water a shallow water effect, which practically changes the water invisible to the eye.
   * However, all elements still work the same way as without the shallow effect - allowing swimming, diving, vehicles to sink, etc.
   * - Note: X and Y positions will be changed to an even integer. i.e. -2, 0, 2, 4 etc.
   * - Important note: If you're working with dimensions, be sure to apply it by using setElementDimension.

However, some MTA custom objects placed underwater will appear in front of the water. Setting the water level to any non-zero value (i.e. setWaterLevel(0.001)) forces alternative rendering and MTA custom objects placed underwater will be drawn correctly.
