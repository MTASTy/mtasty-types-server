  /**
   * This function returns whether or not the given object has access to perform the given action.
   * Scripts frequently wish to limit access to features to particular users.
   * The na√Øve way to do this would be to check if the player who is attempting to perform an action is in a particular group (usually the Admin group).
   * The main issue with doing this is that the Admin group is not guaranteed to exist.
   * It also doesn't give the server admin any flexibility.
   * He might want to allow his 'moderators' access to the function you're limiting access to, or he may want it disabled entirely.
   * This is where using the ACL properly comes in, and luckily this is very easy.
   * It all comes down to using this function.
   * This, somewhat confusingly named function lets you check if an ACL object (a player or a resource) has a particular ACL right.
   * In this case, we just care about players.
   * So, first of all, think of a name for your 'right'.
   * Let's say we want a private area only certain people can go in, we'll call our right accessPrivateArea.
   * Notice that we've named the right using resource.YourResourceName.accessPrivateArea - this is just for neatness, so that the admin knows what resource the right belongs to. It's strongly advised you follow this convention.
   * The false argument specifies the 'defaultPermission', false indicating that if the user hasn't had the right allowed or dissallowed (i.e. the admin hasn't added it to the config), that it should default to being not allowed.
   * The only downside of using this method is that the admin has to modify his config.
   * The upsides are that the admin has much more control and your script will work for any server, however the admin has configured it.
   * - Note: Only certain action names work. This function seems to return undefined and output a bad argument error when checking if an object has rights for an action which doesn't start with function., command. or resource. keywords.
   * @param theAction The action to test if the given object has access to. Ie. "function.kickPlayer".
   * @param [defaultPermission=true] The default permission if none is specified in either of the groups the given object is a member of. If this is left to true, the given object will have permissions to perform the action unless the opposite is explicitly specified in the ACL.If false, the action will be denied by default unless explicitly approved by the Access Control List.
   * @returns Returns true if the given object has permission to perform the given action, false otherwise. Returns undefined if the function failed because of bad arguments.

   * Almost any data types can be passed as expected, including elements and complex nested tables.
   * Non-element MTA data types like xmlNodes or resource pointers will not be able to be passed as they do not necessarily have a valid representation on the client.
   * Events are sent reliably, so clients will receive them, but there may be (but shouldn't be) a significant delay before they are received.
   * You should take this into account when using them.
   * Keep in mind the bandwidth issues when using events - don't pass a large list of arguments unless you really need to. It is marginally more efficient to pass one large event than two smaller ones.
