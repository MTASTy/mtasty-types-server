  /**
   * This function starts a resource either persistently or as a dependency of the current resource.
   * If you start the resource persistently, the resource will run until stopped either using stopResource or by the server admin.
   * A resource started as a dependency will stop when your resource stops, if no other resources have it as a dependency.
   * This is the same effect as using an include in your meta.xml file.
   * The function also allows you to specify a number of boolean options.
   * These allow you to disable the loading of various aspects of the resource.
   * This is generally useful for editors rather than for actual gamemodes.
   * It could also be used as a way to preview a resource before enabling the scripting aspects, though this could produce unreliable results.
   * There is no way for a resource to tell if it is being run with any of these booleans set.
   * @param [persistent=false] A boolean specifying if the resource should continue to run even after this resource has been stopped or not. If this is true then the resource will run until another resource or user terminates it or the server shuts down.
   * @param [startIncludedResources=true] A boolean specifying if the resource's included/dependant resources will be started.
   * @param [loadServerConfigs=true] A boolean specifying if server side config (XML) files should be loaded with the resource.
   * @param [loadMaps=true] A boolean specifying if any .map files will be started with the resource.
   * @param [loadServerScripts=true] A boolean specifying if server side script files should be started alongside the resource.
   * @param [loadHTML=true] A boolean specifying if HTML files should be started alongside the resource.
   * @param [loadClientConfigs=true] A boolean specifying if client configs should be loaded alongside the resource.
   * @param [loadClientScripts=true] A boolean specifying if client scripts should be loaded and started alongside the resource.
   * @param [loadFiles=true] A boolean specifying if client-side files should be loaded alongside the resource.
   * @returns Returns true if the resource has been started successfully, false otherwise.

  /**
   * This function returns whether or not the given object has access to perform the given action.
   * Scripts frequently wish to limit access to features to particular users.
   * The na√Øve way to do this would be to check if the player who is attempting to perform an action is in a particular group (usually the Admin group).
   * The main issue with doing this is that the Admin group is not guaranteed to exist.
   * It also doesn't give the server admin any flexibility.
   * He might want to allow his 'moderators' access to the function you're limiting access to, or he may want it disabled entirely.
   * This is where using the ACL properly comes in, and luckily this is very easy.
   * It all comes down to using this function.
   * This, somewhat confusingly named function lets you check if an ACL object (a player or a resource) has a particular ACL right.
   * In this case, we just care about players.
   * So, first of all, think of a name for your 'right'.
   * Let's say we want a private area only certain people can go in, we'll call our right accessPrivateArea.
   * Notice that we've named the right using resource.YourResourceName.accessPrivateArea - this is just for neatness, so that the admin knows what resource the right belongs to. It's strongly advised you follow this convention.
   * The false argument specifies the 'defaultPermission', false indicating that if the user hasn't had the right allowed or dissallowed (i.e. the admin hasn't added it to the config), that it should default to being not allowed.
   * The only downside of using this method is that the admin has to modify his config.
   * The upsides are that the admin has much more control and your script will work for any server, however the admin has configured it.
   * - Note: Only certain action names work. This function seems to return undefined and output a bad argument error when checking if an object has rights for an action which doesn't start with function., command. or resource. keywords.
   * @param theAction The action to test if the given object has access to. Ie. "function.kickPlayer".
   * @param [defaultPermission=true] The default permission if none is specified in either of the groups the given object is a member of. If this is left to true, the given object will have permissions to perform the action unless the opposite is explicitly specified in the ACL.If false, the action will be denied by default unless explicitly approved by the Access Control List.
   * @returns Returns true if the given object has permission to perform the given action, false otherwise. Returns undefined if the function failed because of bad arguments.
