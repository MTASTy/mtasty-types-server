/**
 * Creates an area of water.
 * The largest possible size of a water area is 5996Ã—5996.
 * Also be aware that the function will change all x and y coordinates you specify into even integer numbers if necessary: this is because of a limitation of San Andreas.
 * You are able to give the water a shallow water effect, which practically changes the water invisible to the eye.
 * However, all elements still work the same way as without the shallow effect - allowing swimming, diving, vehicles to sink, etc.
 * - Note: X and Y positions will be changed to an even integer. i.e. -2, 0, 2, 4 etc.
 * - Important note: If you're working with dimensions, be sure to apply it by using setElementDimension.
 * @param x1 position of bottom left (south-west) corner.
 * @param y1 position of bottom left (south-west) corner.
 * @param z1 position of bottom left (south-west) corner.
 * @param x2 position of bottom right (south-east) corner.
 * @param y2 position of bottom right (south-east) corner.

 * @param x4 position of top right (north-east) corner.
 * @param y4 position of top right (north-east) corner.
 * @param z4 position of top right (north-east) corner.
 * @param [bShallow=false] gives the water a shallow water effect.
 * @returns Returns a water element if successful, false otherwise. The water element can be repositioned with setElementPosition and destroyed with destroyElement.
